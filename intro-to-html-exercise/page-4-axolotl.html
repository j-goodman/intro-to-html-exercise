<h1>The Axolotl</h1>
<h2>The axolotl is a type of salamander native to Mexico.</h2>
<p>Axolotls should not be confused with the larval stage of the closely related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_salamander">tiger salamander</a> (A. tigrinum), which are widespread in much of North America and occasionally become paedomorphic. Neither should they be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necturus">mudpuppies</a> (Necturus spp.), fully aquatic salamanders from a different family that are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance.</p>
