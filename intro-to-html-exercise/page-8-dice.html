<p>Challenge: set up the above image element so that when you click on it, the image displayed changes randomly to show one of the six sides of a dice.</p>
<p>Try opening your console now and see what happens when you click on the image.</p>
<p>See the folder "dice-images" and the file "dice-roller.js"</p>
